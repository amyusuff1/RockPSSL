How I started coding my 'Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock"

I first started of by creating a respositry once i got into gitpod i created a folder and named it assets as i have learned during the love maths tutorial.

Along with the assets folder i created an images folder, css folder and a js folder and placed all of these folders within the assets folder.

After this i created the following files index.html, script.js and style.css. The 'script.js' file went into the 'js folder' and the 'style.css' went into the css folder.

When i had completed doing this i made my initial git commit.
